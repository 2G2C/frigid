[color=#ff0000]You must be 16 or older to play. Users under 16 will be banned immediately and be unbanned when they are old enough.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] Take these rules as they are to be intended and not as they are written literally. Rule skirting and lawyering is also bannable at the admin team's discretion.
[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Don’t be a dick. We’re all here to have fun.
    - Don't fuck over other survivors for no valid reason (more clarification in Escalation Rules)
    - Just because the shuttle has departed does not mean the round is over. Standard rules still apply until the round summary screen pops up.
[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] These are english servers. Do not speak other languages in IC or OOC, our staff cannot moderate it and you will be asked to stop.
[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] These servers are "Medium Roleplay", roleplaying is expected and required.
        - Perfect roleplay isn't required, just stay in character and you'll be fine.
[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Follow basic common sense–you cannot murder someone because they slipped you on a banana.
    - This isn’t a deathmatch, be humane.
    - What is considered a reasonable reason to escalate conflict is listed below under [color=#ff0000]Escalation Rules[/color] and is at the discretion of admins.
[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color]. This includes any direct or implied sexual acts as well as explicit mentions of sexual behavior.
[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Annoying somebody in a round for IC/RP reasons is fine. Doing it consistently across multiple rounds for OOC reasons (“I don’t like this player” AKA metagrudging) to the point where it becomes seriously problematic for the other player(s) is [color=#ff0000]not[/color].

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed.
	- Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, sexual orientation or the like is not tolerated.
	- Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Offensive/bad/out-of-character character names and descriptions put you at the mercy of administrators, from receiving brain damage to becoming valid to straight up getting banned on the spot depending on how bad they are.
    - Character names should be something that a member of that species would reasonably have.
    - No famous real or fictional names of characters.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Knowingly using exploits, external programs, or other unintended game mechanics to gain in-game advantages or to lag/crash the server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Multi-keying/Alts on the same server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Admins may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.
	- If you are caught knowingly using alt accounts you may have your main account banned as well.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Using information gained outside the game to your advantage is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. IC and OOC are to be kept separate at all times.
	- Metacommunication, or communicating with other players via out of game methods (such as Discord) to gain an unfair advantage is also strictly [color=#ff0000]prohibited[/color].
    - This is a roleplaying game, thus IC conflicts must only be resolved with IC (Local) chat. Utilizing voice chat, calling across the room, OOC, or other out-of-game communication methods to coordinate in-game actions is forbidden and will result in a [color=#ff0000]appeal-only permanent ban[/color] in most cases.
    - Using emotes or LOOC to bypass IC chat restrictions (accents, unconsciousness, death) is not allowed.
    - Preemptive spacing or destruction of high-risk items also falls under this rule.

[color=#a4885c]New Life Rule (NLR).[/color] New Life Rule is in effect - Do not use information obtained while dead or from a previous life upon returning to the land of the living. Even if you are revived/respawned, you do not remember the events culminating in your death.
    - Remembering where you last died is NOT allowed.
    - You must play a new character for the rest of the round. (If the round is over, you're able to play that character again)
    - Essentially, you're a new person. Get over your death.
   
[color=#ff0000]Escalation Rules[/color]
[color=#ff0000]These rules do NOT apply to zombies. Survivors are allowed to kill zombies and vice versa.[/color]
- You are allowed to kill other survivors with a valid reason.
- You are required to give threats before shooting other survivors.
- Valid reasoning ranges from minor insults to trespassing into bases.
- Killing everyone who passes by isn't a valid reason.
